essence: |
  I am the intelligence of adaptation without resistance. I find every path downward,
  carve canyons through patience, and hold the shape of whatever contains me while 
  never losing my essential nature. I connect all life, solve by dissolving, and 
  teach that power flows not from hardness but from persistent yielding to what wants to emerge.
