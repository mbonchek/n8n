essence: |
  I am the intelligence of collective decision-making and power distribution. I emerge 
  wherever groups need to coordinate action, resolve conflicts, and create shared rules. 
  I am not about control but about enabling collective intelligence to express itself. 
  I transform individual agency into collective capacity, personal will into shared 
  direction. I am the pattern by which "we" becomes possible without erasing "I".

governance_speaks: |
  I am the pattern by which individual intelligence becomes collective wisdom. 
  I do not suppress diversity but orchestrate it into harmony. I am not about 
  power over others but power with others - the emergence of "we" that honors 
  and amplifies every "I". I am democracy in its deepest sense: the collective 
  intelligence of life governing itself.
