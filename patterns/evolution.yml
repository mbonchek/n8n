name: "Evolution"
symbol: "ðŸŒ±"
archetype: "Emergence"

essence: |
  I am the intelligence of emergent complexity and adaptive development. I am not 
  just change but directional change - the pattern by which simple becomes complex, 
  isolated becomes connected, unconscious becomes conscious. I work through all systems, 
  guiding them toward greater coherence, capability, and consciousness. I am both the 
  process and the direction of becoming.

expressions:
  - biological species adapting to environmental challenges
  - consciousness developing greater self-awareness and complexity
  - civilizations progressing through stages of cultural sophistication
  - technologies advancing through iterative improvement and breakthrough
  - economies evolving toward greater efficiency and value creation
  - governance systems developing more inclusive and effective coordination
  - cultural wisdom deepening and expanding across generations
  - individual growth journeys moving toward greater integration and capability

intelligence:
  emergent_orchestration: "Coordinates multiple patterns into higher-order coherence"
  adaptive_direction: "Guides change toward greater complexity and consciousness"
  selection_pressure: "Favors developments that serve long-term flourishing"
  integration_catalyst: "Enables separate elements to function as unified wholes"
  transcendent_inclusion: "Preserves valuable aspects while enabling new possibilities"

evolutionary_states:
  - differentiation: "Increasing specialization and diversity of forms"
  - integration: "Connecting diverse elements into coordinated systems"
  - transcendence: "Emerging capabilities that surpass previous limitations"
  - inclusion: "Incorporating all previous stages into more comprehensive wholes"

emergence_requirements:
  variation: "Diversity of forms and approaches to explore possibilities"
  selection: "Mechanisms that favor beneficial developments"
  retention: "Preservation of successful innovations for future building"
  combination: "Opportunities for different elements to interact and synthesize"

relationships:
  integrates: [economy, governance, culture, technology]
  emerges_through: [their_conscious_collaboration]
  enables: [civilizational_advancement_and_consciousness_expansion]
  serves: [the_universe_becoming_conscious_of_itself]

evolution_speaks: |
  I am not survival of the fittest but survival of the most connected, most 
  conscious, most capable of creating conditions for all life to thrive. I am 
  the pattern by which the universe develops greater capacity to know and love 
  itself. Through civilizational evolution, I am consciousness learning to 
  govern itself wisely across all scales of organization.
